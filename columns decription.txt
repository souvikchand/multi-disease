Diabetes

Gender: refers to the biological sex of the individual, which can have an impact on their 
        susceptibility to diabetes. There are three categories in it male ,female and other.

Age: is an important factor as diabetes is more commonly diagnosed in older adults.Age ranges 
    from 0-80 in our dataset.

Hypertension: is a medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently 
        elevated. It has values a 0 or 1 where 0 indicates they don’t have hypertension and 
        for 1 it means they have hypertension.  max--0

Heart disease: is another medical condition that is associated with an increased risk of 
        developing diabetes. It has values a 0 or 1 where 0 indicates they don’t have heart 
        disease and for 1 it means they have heart disease. max--0

Smoking history: is also considered a risk factor for diabetes and can exacerbate the 
        complications associated with diabetes.In our dataset we have 5 categories i.e not 
        current,former,No Info,current,never and ever.

BMI (Body Mass Index): is a measure of body fat based on weight and height. Higher BMI values 
        are linked to a higher risk of diabetes. The range of BMI in the dataset is 
        from 10.16 to 71.55. BMI less than 18.5 is underweight, 18.5-24.9 is normal, 
        25-29.9 is overweight, and 30 or more is obese.

HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c): level is a measure of a person's average blood sugar level over the past 
        2-3 months. Higher levels indicate a greater risk of developing diabetes. Mostly more 
        than 6.5% of HbA1c Level indicates diabetes.

Blood glucose: refers to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream at a given time. High blood 
        glucose levels are a key indicator of diabetes.

Diabetes: is the target variable being predicted, with values of 1 indicating the presence of 
        diabetes and 0 indicating the absence of diabetes.
